        <p style="line-height: 1.8;"><image src="assets/images/profilepicture.jpg" id="profilepic">My name is Nick Ward and I'm learning to become a computer programmer. Don't let this profile picture fool you into thinking I have elite skills. I am but a simple sales rep at my current job with little to no experience programming.</p>
        <p style="line-height: 1.8;">I was born in a paper sack, in the bottom of a sewer. I had to eat dirt clumps for breakfast because my family was so poor. My dad was a waitress and my mom sold bathroom tiles. My brothers and sisters all hated me because I was an only child. My parents sold me for a nickel when I'm clearly worth a dime. Clocks cost more then a nickel so I wasn't worth their time.</p>
        <p style="line-height: 1.8;"></p>Now that I've become old, I enjoy long YouTube videos of people walking on the beach and the fresh air when I let my pug go out for a pee.</image>
